        <p>People ask Crystal Clear Audio,<br>
           - How good are your solid silver Crystal Clear interconnects?<br>
           - Some described the best cables in the world.<br>
           - But how good are these silver Crystal Clear interconnects?<br>
           - So good they might even be superior to the other interconnects you now own. So good they might put cash in your pocket when you decide to sell your present ones at auction.</p>
        <p>We want you to listen! How else does a new company with a superb new <strong>breakthrough state-of-the-art interconnect—one able to compare favorably to products three, five and ten times as expensive</strong> but without the means to advertise and get reviewed—get its message across to a skeptical audience when everyone—I mean, <strong>everyone</strong>-raves about how awesome their interconnects are?</p>
        <p>Only one way. <strong>Ask you to listen, to listen at no risk on your own sound system in your own home</strong>. Burn them in. Then have an A-B session with friends to see how these <strong>Crystal Clear</strong> interconnects stack up against the best your friends can throw at them. </p>
        <p>Don’t take our word for how outstanding the <strong>Crystal Clear</strong> interconnects are, listen to what <strong>knowledgeable owners—owners with trained ears</strong>—have to say about <strong>Crystal Clear Audio</strong> interconnects:</p>

            <p>The BMW of cables—not the best looking or the most expensive, but the best all round performer...Crystal Clear interconnects have all the lifelike clarity of solid silver, with detail and a fullness, warmth and musicality rare in cables at any price...In direct A-B comparisons (which Mel of Crystal Clear Audio urges all owners of his cables to make) playing CDs and SACDs, jazz and classical, vocal and instrumental with some of the finest and most expensive cables by Synergistic Research--the $1000 active shielding Resolution Research and the $2000 active shielding Designer Reference Research, played over a Sony SCD 777ES, a VTL preamp and mono blocks, and PSB Silveri loudspeakers, the Crystal Standard was so good we got the cables confused...Your Crystal Standard was often better, rarely inferior, and most surprising, as quiet. Absolutely amazing!</p>

          <p>I have recommended your cables every chance I get and now I am going to do so even more...I have hooked the [Crystal Standard] cables up to my system from the Levinson amp to the Green Mountain Audio Continuum 1.5 and the sound is fabulous. The speaker cables may even be better than the interconnects...They are full of information with surprisingly good bass, even without really being broken in. A very dark background as well, but a natural one as well... Exceptional. I know a lot about audio and have had a lot of equipment.</p>

          <p>No cable is right for everyone, or excels in every sonic respect on any given sound system, but I’m impressed with how many things your [Crystal Reference] interconnect did well and how few it did badly—none, really...Your major problem is going to be to persuade people to think outside the box. How do you get people who have been educated to equate price with quality interconnects can be state of the art? They won’t believe it. They don’t want to believe it.</p>

        <p><strong>What give Crystal Clear Audio interconnects their unusual sonic excellence?</strong> Many things—<strong>the silver r, the interconnect geometry, the shielding material, and, finally, Mel’s secret multi-stepped musical tuning process</strong>. Mel tunes the silver wire just as Stradivarius tuned the sound box of the violins he crafted. Result: Crystal Clear Audio cables sing instead of ring.<p>

        <p>If you’re interested in learning more about interconnect theory, about why Crystal Clear Audio interconnects are among the very, very best sounding interconnects you can buy at <strong>any price</strong>, and about our product lines and prices, please visit our website. Browse and inform yourself at your leisure. What have you got to lose? Nothing! Fact is, you may put some change in your pocket by selling those expensive interconnects you now own.</p>

          <p>Mel,</p>
          <p>Here is my non-clinical review of your new Studio Reference USB cable and my two setups so far:</p>
          <p>1.)First setup was of course with the ipod 5th generation touch, Crystal Clear Audio Studio reference USB cable/ Herus Dac amp and JH-16 IEMs.</p>

          <p>Sonic and musicality was unbeatable with any other cable as I was fortunate to sit around at Addicted to Audio and switch from cable to cable. There was an ease and performance that the other cables could not touch. The music genres went from rock to jazz to classical. I noticed the background noise was dead silent and there was no harshness as with the Wire World Platinum. The small setup sounded better than any full size DAC/Amp I have heard to date and the richness from this cable and setup I feel could not have sounded any better. I thought….enter the modded pair of Grado Allesandro Pro headphones with the Crystal Clear Audio Studio reference USB cable and the Herus DAC/ Amp.</p>

          <p>2.) Second setup was ipod 5th generation touch, Crystal Clear Audio Studio reference USB cable/ Herus DAC/Amp and the Grados (modded a bit).</p>

          <p>TWO WORDS>>>>COMPLETELY UNBELIEVABLE! I thought I had the setup that would be the killer with the JH-16s and your cable(the Great balls of fire!) , I could walk in silence and smile knowing no one would ever have a mobile setup with a cable this great. This was now second best as the Crystal Clear Audio Studio reference USB cable created musical heaven on earth. I hate to keep trying this cable on further setups because I will end up wanting to spend a shit load of money on gear. If anyone says USB cables don’t make a difference they are full of it and you can take that to the bank or have them call me. It’s time for the nay sayers to shut up, have a coke and a smile, and sit back and take a listen. Thanks for everything brother and the greatest customer service on earth to date!</p>

          <p>You will probably be getting a call from Addicted to Audio, they loved it.</p>
          <p>Thanks Again,</p>

          <p>Mel-<br>
          I wanted to get a bit of time on the cables prior to emailing. I must tell you I am thoroughly impressed! Many times we continue to upgrade our electronics in an effort to improve sound no looking at the cables as an essential link in the chain. Not that I am so naive to think cables wouldn't improve the system I would never think to spend the uber amounts of money some esoteric cables demand. Your cables have allowed me to improve/experience my system at a whole new level. What I find very appealing is the presentation where I now have a soundfeild independent of the speakers as if the speakers are not there, amazing. In addition, the level of resolution coupled with exemplary midrange and deep tight non boomy bass is extraordinary, my hat is off to you.<br>
          Thank you for all you have done to improve my system.<br>
          Best Regards,
          </p>

          <p>Mel wanted you to know I finally got my Marten speakers today and finally got a chance to hear the system don't know how to describe the sound the detail is to die for and I'm sure your Magnum Opus speakercables have a lot do with it. Can't thank you enough for your help. The sound I'm getting now is way better than I anticipated. Best Regards.</p>
